"Have you ever watched a movie and noticed a glaring continuity error? Maybe Forrest Gump buying Apple stocks in 1975, the car in the Lord of the Rings, Bradley Cooper holding a fake baby. One moment, you're immersed in the Land of Oz, and the next, you're noticing every time Dorothy's hair grows and shrinks a few inches between shots."

"There's something funny about our awareness of continuity errors in film. The fact that Harry Potter could fly on a broomstick didn't raise any flags for me, but seeing the bike seat on the broomstick is a glaring error."
"Much like the world-building in a Hollywood movie, we are not focused on real-world accuracy when we measure Consistency. Rather, we are focused on if the information matches up across systems.   "
":red[__Consistency__] measures whether data is the same, in format and in value, across multiple instances. Consistency is an important dimension of data quality because it allows our data to talk to one another.  "
"If this is starting to sound familiar, great! Consistency is closely related to the data quality dimension we explored in our last module: accuracy."

'Inconsistent data is common when dealing with multiple systems, making it challenging to link systems to one another and get values to match up. '
'How do we make sure our data is consistent? One helpful tool is our data catalog, which will be live next month (stay tuned!). We work with Data Stewards to make sure our data is clearly described, and make it simple to trace the data lineage.  '
